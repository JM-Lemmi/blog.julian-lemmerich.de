### 05.06.2023: [OSM Diary: Mapping the Weinsberger Berge](230605-osm1.html)

Inspired by [Tom7](http://tom7.org/) to go outside more, I set myself the goal of biking every Forestpath between Weinsberg and Heilbronn, before I will be moving avay in the Summer.

### 01.07.2022: [Controlling OpenAutoPro with Volvo RTI IR-Remote](220701-volvoir.html)

### 27.06.22: [Automatic Number Plate Recognition 1: OpenALPR](220627-anpr1.html)

In the first article of this series I will be looking at OpenALPR. The software is easy to use, comes with compiled binaries for windows and doesn't need a fancy GPU or anything like that. It also has bind ins for python and Go, which would ease integration into a live system.

### 27.06.22: [Automatic Number Plate Recognition 0: Can't be that hard, right?](220627-anpr0.html)

The start of a number plate nerd trying to teach his rpi to remember all the other cars. ANPR is surely a solved problem by now, right?

### 11.05.22: [Android 11 Eduroam without gededuroam App](220511-eduroamnoapp.html)

### 08.05.22: [Docker IPv6 Userland Proxy](220508-dockeripv6-userlandproxy.html)

Some interesting information about the Docker IPv6 Userland Proxy and how to better use it, despite Docker's horrible implementation.

### 22.04.22: [Nginx Proxy from Scratch](220424-nginxproxy.html)

Setting up an Nginx Reverse-Proxy from bare Nginx with certificates and automatic renewal.
