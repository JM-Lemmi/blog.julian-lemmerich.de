# Telefonica Germany activated IPv6 on their mobile network yesterday

Yesterday Telefonica Germany, as the last of the big 3, activated IPv6 on their mobile networks for all existing customers: [Original Announcement in German](https://www.telefonica.de/news/corporate/2021/04/mehr-ip-adressen-und-endgeraete-im-netz-o2-kunden-nutzen-internet-protokolle-ipv4-und-ipv6-im-parallelbetrieb.html)

Remember to check your APN settings, if its using Dual Stack.

I will be testing it out, if it works with Hotspots etc in the next few days.
